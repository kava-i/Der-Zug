All command igonore case. In addition partial matching works. So instead of writing "pick up pack of cigaretts" you may enter "pick up cigaretts" or even "pick up cig". This only works for people, exits, items etc. not for commands. So "show invent" does not work, "show inventory" is neccesarry. However instead of writing "go to", "talk to", "pick up" etc. you may simply write "go", "talk", "pick" etc.
